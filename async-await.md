# Async Await

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows for the execution of multiple tasks concurrently, without having to wait for each task to complete before moving on to the next one. In traditional synchronous programming, each task is executed one after the other, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.

**Async/await** is a language feature that was introduced in ES2017 (also known as ECMAScript 8) to make asynchronous programming easier and more intuitive. It allows developers to write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of async/await, including how to define asynchronous functions, how to use the async and await keywords, and how to handle errors in asynchronous code.

## Defining Asynchronous Functions

An asynchronous function is a function that returns a Promise. Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and they allow us to handle the result of an asynchronous operation when it becomes available.

*To define an asynchronous function, we use the async keyword before the function name:*

```
async function doAsyncTask() {
  // perform asynchronous operation here
}
```

The function body can contain any asynchronous code, such as making an HTTP request or reading a file from disk. When the function is called, it returns a Promise that resolves to the result of the asynchronous operation.

## Using the Async Keyword

The async keyword can be used in two ways: as an async function declaration or as an async function expression.

## Async Function Declaration

An async function declaration is a named function that is defined using the async keyword:

```
async function doAsyncTask() {
  // perform asynchronous operation here
}
```

## Async Function Expression

An async function expression is an anonymous function that is defined using the async keyword:

```
const doAsyncTask = async function() {
  // perform asynchronous operation here
}
```

## Using the Await Keyword

The await keyword can only be used inside an async function, and it is used to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved.

When an async function encounters an await expression, it pauses the execution of the function and waits for the Promise to be resolved. Once the Promise is resolved, the function resumes execution and the result of the Promise is returned.

Here is an example of using the await keyword to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete:

```
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

Defining Asynchronous Functions

An asynchronous function is a function that returns a Promise. Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and they allow us to handle the result of an asynchronous operation when it becomes available.

To define an asynchronous function, we use the async keyword before the function name:

javascript
Copy code
async function doAsyncTask() {
  // perform asynchronous operation here
}
The function body can contain any asynchronous code, such as making an HTTP request or reading a file from disk. When the function is called, it returns a Promise that resolves to the result of the asynchronous operation.

Using the Async Keyword

The async keyword can be used in two ways: as an async function declaration or as an async function expression.

Async Function Declaration

An async function declaration is a named function that is defined using the async keyword:

javascript
Copy code
async function doAsyncTask() {
  // perform asynchronous operation here
}
Async Function Expression

An async function expression is an anonymous function that is defined using the async keyword:

javascript
Copy code
const doAsyncTask = async function() {
  // perform asynchronous operation here
}
Using the Await Keyword

The await keyword can only be used inside an async function, and it is used to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved.

When an async function encounters an await expression, it pauses the execution of the function and waits for the Promise to be resolved. Once the Promise is resolved, the function resumes execution and the result of the Promise is returned.

Here is an example of using the await keyword to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete:

javascript
Copy code
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
In this example, the fetchData function makes an HTTP request to retrieve data from an external API. The fetch function returns a Promise that resolves to a response object. We use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved and we can access the response object.

We then use the response.json() method to read the response body and parse it as JSON. Again, we use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved and we can access the parsed data.

## Handling Errors

When working with asynchronous code, it's important to handle errors appropriately. In traditional synchronous programming, errors can be handled using try/catch blocks. In asynchronous programming, we can use the same try/catch blocks, but we need to make sure that we handle errors from Promises correctly.

Here is an example of using try/catch to handle errors in asynchronous code:

```
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}
```

In this example, we use try/catch to wrap the asynchronous code that could potentially throw an error. If an error occurs during the execution of the async function, it will be caught by the catch block, where we can handle the error appropriately.

If an error is thrown in a Promise, the Promise will be rejected and we can handle the rejection using the catch method of the Promise:

```
fetch('https://example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Data:', data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });
```

In this example, we use the then method of the Promise to handle the success case, where the Promise is resolved with the response object. If the response is not ok, we throw an error using the throw statement.

If an error is thrown in the Promise, the Promise is rejected and the catch method is called, where we can handle the error appropriately.

## Conclusion

Async/await is a powerful feature that makes asynchronous programming easier and more intuitive. It allows us to write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.

When defining asynchronous functions, we use the async keyword to indicate that the function returns a Promise. We can then use the await keyword inside the function to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved.

When working with asynchronous code, it's important to handle errors appropriately using try/catch blocks or the catch method of Promises. This ensures that errors are caught and handled appropriately, rather than causing unexpected behavior in our application.
